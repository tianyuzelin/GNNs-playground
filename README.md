# [🚀ONGOING] Collection of Graph Neural Networks

## Statement

Hey there! This will be my repo implementing GRAPH related DL models, with some tutorials and notes!! **I will be consistently updating this repository**.

## Models

- `2021-10-22 gcn-pytorch-jiaxu` Graph Convolutional Network implementation, similar to https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907.

- `2021-10-27 dgi-pytorch-jiaxu` Deep Graph Infomax implementation, similar to https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10341.

## DataSets

- `CORA` https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA
